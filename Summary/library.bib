	abstract = {Since 1980 the proportion of males appears to have increased to -50\% in the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations of Lakes Superior and Huron following a period (1970-1980) of stability. In Lake Ontario, there has been a shift from an approximately equal sex ratio (1970-1980) to a slight preponderance ( - 60\%) of males. Multiple regression analysis indicated that prey availability (reflected by salmonid stocking or commercial catch) was significantly related to the observed changes in length, weight, and proportion of males. We also found that, while sea lamprey length and weight may have stabilized in Lake Superior (1960 to present), sea lamprey have generally become larger in both Lakes Huron and Ontario. Again, prey availability was most closely related to weight of sea lamprey. Sex ratio and adult weight in Great Lakes sea lamprey appear to be related to prey availability and therefore may not be adequate indicators of the success ofsea lamprey control.},

	abstract = {The classical Lotka-Volterra equations that model the interactions between two species competing for a limited resource have many potential modifications to improve biological accuracy; this paper explores modifications to the exponent of the competition term. After an introduction to the behavior of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is given, a nonlinear modification to this model by Taylor and Crizer is discussed. In section 2, an extension of this modification is proposed, in which the population variable of the competition term is raised first to the power of positive real numbers and, next, small integers. A proof is offered that at most 3 coexistent equilibrium points exist for any positive exponent values, and additional proofs further limit the number of equilibria for certain exponent and parameter values. In section 3, we prove that, in such models, the stability of the equilibria alternates between stable and unstable when considered in a northwest to southeast configuration. Combining these results allows us to describe the equilibrium behavior of a broad class of competition models.},

	abstract = {Effective control of aquatic invasive species requires knowledge of the population throughout the infested area. Lake-wide assessments of invasive sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) are used to assess their status in the Laurentian Great Lakes, informing ﬁsheries managers and decision makers in the sea lamprey control program. Initially these assessments focused on an estimate of absolute abundance, but later switched to an estimate of relative abundance as an index. In this paper, we describe the recently developed index of sea lamprey abundance and the reasons for its use. Rather than trying to estimate spawning run sizes of all Great Lakes tributaries, the index instead estimates run sizes of a small subset of index streams. Streams chosen for the index had large spawning runs and a history of trapping operations that consistently yielded mark-recapture estimates. This change enabled the sea lamprey control program to abandon a previously used regression model that predicted run size on streams with no sea lamprey traps. Further research is needed to determine how strongly correlated the index is with actual patterns in the lake-wide population of adult sea lampreys.},

	abstract = {Redd counts are commonly applied to estimate spawning population size for salmonids and allow for broad spatial and temporal coverage in monitoring efforts. However, the utility of redd counts may be compromised by observation error, particularly with respect to superimposition, where later arriving spawners construct redds overlapping existing redds. Here, we provide a mechanistic evaluation of the effects of superimposition on the error structure and biological signiﬁcance of redd count data for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) spawning within tributaries to the Snake River, Wyoming. We used a Bayesian framework to parse observation error into distinct components and found low detection of redd clusters (i.e., areas of superimposition) was offset by overestimates of the number of redds per cluster, such that observed counts accurately reﬂected census redd abundance. However, a saturating relationship between redd counts and spawner abundance indicated that counts is best interpreted as effective reproductive effort rather than spawner abundance. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of redd count data that can be used to assess their application and interpretation for monitoring.},

	abstract = {Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) are an aquatic nuisance species that cause great harm to ﬁshes in the Great Lakes. Control of sea lamprey is vital to protecting the Great Lakes ﬁshery, and designing an effective control program depends on accurate knowledge of their demographics. This study compared historical and current data on female sea lamprey length, weight, fecundity, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and egg weight in the Great Lakes. Female sea lamprey captured in 2011 were compared with studies conducted in 1960 and 1981 on Lake Superior and in 1981 and 1999 on Lake Ontario, as well as available data from Lakes Huron, Michigan and Erie. In Lake Superior, mean length and weight of female sea lamprey increased by approximately 13\% and 45\%, respectively, while mean fecundity increased 17\% and individual egg weights increased 43\%. There was no difference in mean sea lamprey GSI in Lake Superior. In Lake Ontario, female sea lamprey length increased by 7\%, but there were no differences in the other metrics. Across the Great Lakes, there was a general increase in fecundity from the period before the 1980s to more recent years. An increased population of larger parasitic sea lamprey will have higher feeding rates and thus a higher impact on commercially and ecologically important ﬁshes. Managers may need to reconsider control targets and lampricide treatment frequency for lakes where sea lamprey growth and fecundity have increased.},

	abstract = {We examined how attack frequency by sea lampreys on ﬁshes in Lake Ontario varied in response to sea lamprey abundance and preferred host abundance (lake trout N 433 mm). For this analysis we used two gill net assessment surveys, one angler creel survey, three salmonid spawning run datasets, one adult sea lamprey assessment, and a bottom trawl assessment of dead lake trout. The frequency of fresh sea lamprey marks observed on lake trout from assessment surveys was strongly related to the frequency of sea lamprey attacks observed on salmon and trout from the creel survey and spawning migrations. Attack frequencies on all salmonids examined were related to the ratio between the abundances of adult sea lampreys and lake trout. Reanalysis of the susceptibility to sea lamprey attack for lake trout strains stocked into Lake Ontario reafﬁrmed that Lake Superior strain lake trout were among the most and Seneca Lake strain among the least susceptible and that Lewis Lake strain lake trout were even more susceptible than the Superior strain. Seasonal attack frequencies indicated that as the number of observed sea lamprey attacks decreased during June–September, the ratio of healing to fresh marks also decreased. Simulation of the ratios of healing to fresh marks indicated that increased lethality of attacks by growing sea lampreys contributed to the decline in the ratios and supported laboratory studies about wound healing duration.},

	abstract = {Understanding the population structure of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Great Lakes basin is essential for an effective control program. We review knowledge of lake connectivity, dispersal during the parasitic stage, and results from phenotypic, demographic, and genetic studies to evaluate how sea lamprey populations are structured. There is no evidence for contemporary movement between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic population, although it appears possible. Dispersal between Lake Ontario and the Finger Lakes is more likely, as is contemporary movement between Lakes Ontario and Erie via the Welland Canal, although neither has been directly observed. Downstream movement from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario via the Niagara River has been reported. Bidirectional movement between Lakes Erie and Huron has been observed, and movement of sea lamprey among the upper Great Lakes (especially between Lakes Huron and Michigan) is relatively common, although complete mixing likely does not occur. The maximum straight-line dispersal distance reported for a tagged sea lamprey was 628 km between the St. Marys River and western Lake Erie. Genetic population studies using a variety of molecular markers generally found weak but signiﬁcant broad-scale population structure (e.g., between freshwater and anadromous populations, and among Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and the upper Great Lakes), but ﬁner-scale structure was rarely detected. Nevertheless, some within-basin structure is suggested by regional differences in phenotypic and demographic traits (e.g., sex ratio, body size). Further study will be important because management is most efﬁciently targeted when the geography of demographically independent populations is well-characterized.},

Females mated 20–196 times during a breeding experiment, of which sham mating comprised 35–90\%. The number of eggs released may be physically constrained in each mating by the lamprey’s elongated body and behavior. Female lampreys might also control egg release depending on surrounding males.},

This ability would beneﬁt conservation of one such declining species, anadromous Paciﬁc lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). Nonphilopatric migration of adult Paciﬁc lamprey has homogenized population-level neutral variation but has maintained adaptive variation that differentiates groups based on geography, run-timing and adult body form. To investigate causes for this adaptive divergence, we examined 647 adult lamprey sampled at a ﬁxed location on the Columbia River and radiotracked during their subsequent upstream migration. We tested whether genetic variation [94 neutral and adaptive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identiﬁed from a genomewide association study] was associated with phenotypes of migration distance, migration timing, or morphology. Three adaptive markers were strongly associated with morphology, and one marker also correlated with upstream migration distance and timing. Genes physically linked with these markers plausibly inﬂuence differences in body size, which is also consistently associated with migration distance in Paciﬁc lamprey. Paciﬁc lamprey conservation implications include the potential to predict an individual’s upstream destination based on its genotype. More broadly, the results suggest a genetic basis for intrapopulation variation in migration distance in migratory species.},
